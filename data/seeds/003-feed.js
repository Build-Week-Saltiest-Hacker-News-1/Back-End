        "Huawei had to license synopsys/cadence/mentor to design their chip(which is using ARM core), if US really wants to play hardball Huawei's IC design can be killed nearly instantly once those CAD design software is forbidden. In the meantime I heard Huawei etc bought a few years' license right before the trade war, they're actually well prepared. Another way is to restrict chip manufacturing, Taiwan pretty much owns the best technology for that(TSMC), Intel/Samsung has some, Huawei has none. And you have Android to some degree, without Android there is no Smartphone dominance from China as of now. Open source in general helped China to catch up and overtake the west extremely efficiently, you don't need any business spies anymore, just download/modify/profit. At the moment USA still has the possibility to contain IC ecosystem if it really wants to do that. In 10~20 years it will be a different story though, by then USA might not have much leverage if anything at all left.",

        "Kind-of alluded to in the article, but if you\u2019re going to unbundle AWS, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to get the bandwidth 0-rated. One of amazons biggest moats (imo) is that they can realize monumental cost savings on bandwidth while making it very pricy to other service providers. So if you need to architect bandwidth-hungry or \u201chigh scale\u201d applications, going outside of AWS becomes way too expensive. Even privatelink tacks on bandwidth charges. You\u2019d have to look at DB providers like Elastic to see how to do this, I think. But it\u2019s going to involve a very complex and high touch deployment & support environment. This effectively \u201cprices out\u201d certain classes of applications as too expensive for value returned. Again I could be looking at this very wrong, and figuring out how to build profitable unbundled AWS services would be a great business, but it\u2019s hard to see how to successfully execute.",

First, fire whoever decided to prevent syncing Google Photos to Drive and not having a compatible Photos API for syncing original backups. Next, invest in and add features to Google Music or stop charging for it. Last, Google News sucks. No matter how much I dislike content it keeps showing me more of the same. Reminds me of YouTube.

        "This is one of the most simplististic, reductionary arguments against socialism I have read. Anyone who uses the 'human nature' argument shouldn't be taken seriously. Especially with this article's mischaraterization of socialism in the first place. The idea that all of human nature can be boiled down to only the 'selfish' and 'greedy' traits is pretty insulting, and in this case, propagandistic. We really shouldn't continue nurturing the selfishness and greed traits on a mass scale as we currently do. Socialism is never about people working for free or forcing lazy people to work. Its about workers owning the means of production. Giving workers dignity and eliminating the oppresive employer - employee relationship. Slave owners also thought that they were unfairly being \"forced\" to give up their freedoms of owning people.",
