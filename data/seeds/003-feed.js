First, fire whoever decided to prevent syncing Google Photos to Drive and not having a compatible Photos API for syncing original backups. Next, invest in and add features to Google Music or stop charging for it. Last, Google News sucks. No matter how much I dislike content it keeps showing me more of the same. Reminds me of YouTube. People should get heated on Google curating propaganda.",
